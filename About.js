      <h1>About Eco Eats</h1>
      <p>
        Every year, grocery stores and restaurants discard mountains of unsold yet perfectly edible food. This isn’t just waste—it’s a lost chance to nourish the hungry, a burden on our planet, and a hit to businesses' bottom lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Food waste fuels landfills, increases global hunger, and drains financial resources. Imagine a solution where this surplus finds purpose. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Eco Eats</strong> is a platform that rescues food, uplifts communities, and redefines sustainability.
